## Installation

***

```bash
composer require milwad/laravel-crod
```

After installation, you need to publish config files. <br>

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Milwad\LaravelCrod\LaravelCrodServiceProvider" --tag="laravel-crod-config"
```

## Check active commands

When you install the `Laravel Crod`, a series of commands will be activated for you. For see these commands, you can run below command: <br>

```bash
php artisan
```

![Crod commands](https://s6.uupload.ir/files/carbon_(1)_tqmq.png "Crod commands")

## Make CRUD files

For creating crud files, you need to run the `crud:make` command in your terminal: <br>

```bash
php artisan crud:make {name}
``` 

<br>

For example <br>

```bash
php artisan crud:make Product
```

When you execute this command, after creating the files, you will see a list of options that will create a series of additional files for you, which of course are optional, you can choose and if you need, it will create additional files for you such as `seeder`, `factory`, `repository`, etc.

âœ… After, you can see `Laravel Crod` creates crud files such as `Model`, `Controller`, `Form-Requests`, `Migrations` etc.

## CRUD Query

If you run `crud:query` command, the result is:

- Add `index`, `create`, `store`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy` function to your controller
- Get all migration columns and move it to your model fillable
- Add `index`, `findById`, `delete` functions to your repositories
- Add `store`, `update` functions to your services
- Add resource route (SOON)

<strong>** You must run the migrate command, before `crud:query` command. ** </strong> <br>

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

For using automatic query, you can run below command:

```bash
php artisan crud:query {table_name} {model} {--id-controller}
```

For example:

```bash
php artisan crud:query products Product
```

When write `--id-controller` option add function without route model binding.
When you add `--id-controller` option, the `Laravel Crod` create crud functions without [Route Model Binding](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-model-binding) in controller.

After you can see `Laravel Crod` added query to service, repository, controller, model, etc.

## CRUD for module

Run this command in the terminal, This command created CRUD file for module.

```bash
php artisan crud:make-module {module_name}
```

For example

```bash
php artisan crud:make-module Product
```

When you execute this command, after creating the files, you will see a list of options that will create a series of additional files for you, which of course are optional, you can choose and if you need, it will create additional files for you such as `seeder`, `factory`, `repository`, etc.

     * This is a word that move into the latest name of repository file, for ex: ProductRepo.
     * If this value is changed, any repos that are created will be renamed, for ex: ProductRepository.
    */
    'repository_namespace' => 'Repo',

    /*
     * Get main controller.
     *
     * This is a namespace of main controller that default path is `App\Http\Controllers\Controller`.
     */
    'main_controller' => 'App\Http\Controllers\Controller',

    /*
     * Are using PEST?
     *
     * If you are using PEST framework, you can change it this value to `true`.
     */
    'are_using_pest' => false,

    /*
     * Route namespace.
     *
     * This is a word that move into the latest name of route file.
     */
    'route_namespace' => '',

    /*
     * Route name.
     *
     * This is a word that name of route file.
     */
    'route_name' => 'web',

    /*
     * Modules config.
     *
     * You can make custom modules with special folders ... .
     */
    'modules' => [
        'module_namespace'  => 'Modules', // This value is for the name of the folder that the modules are in.
        'model_path'        => 'Entities', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module models.
        'migration_path'    => 'Database\Migrations', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module migrations.
        'controller_path'   => 'Http\Controllers', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module controllers.
        'request_path'      => 'Http\Requests', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module requests-form.
        'view_path'         => 'Resources\Views', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module views.
        'service_path'      => 'Services', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module services.
        'repository_path'   => 'Repositories', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module Repositories.
        'feature_test_path' => 'Tests\Feature', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module feature-tests.
        'unit_test_path'    => 'Tests\Unit', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module unit-tests.
        'provider_path'     => 'Providers', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module providers.

        'seeder_path'       => 'Database\Seeders', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module seeders.
        'route_path'        => 'Routes', // This value is for the name of the folder that contains the module routes.
    ],

    /*
     * Queries.
     *
     * This is some config for add queries.
     */
    'queries' => [
        /*
         * Except columns in fillable.
         *
         * This `except_columns_in_fillable` must be arrayed!
         * This `except_columns_in_fillable` that remove field from $fillable in model.
         */
        'except_columns_in_fillable' => [
            'id', 'updated_at', 'created_at',
        ],
    ],
];
```

This config file is very helpful to custom path or latest name file.
